# Blockland Repository
Source for Blockland Add-On Repository.

## DISCLAIMER
**This project is still in development and should _not_ be used in production!**

Feel free to request a fork.

## Description
This project is created as an alternative for the previous closed Return To Blockland Add-On hosting site for the game Blockland. Additionally it is released with full source for anyone to download, modify and/or re-release however they like.

Its current status is that it has no prototype yet. It also is only a handful people working on it on their free time.

## Plans
For the time being, highest priority is to get out a working version that can be tested.

Current features include:

*   Basic handling of add-ons and their internal file system along with verification
*   Repository structure
*   Basic API to download add-ons
*   Compatibility towards Greek2me's [Add-On Updater](https://bitbucket.org/Greek2me/support_updater)

Other than that, upcoming features might include:

*   User login and verification
*   Script verification (As well as dependency checks)
*   Server collaboration by exchanging add-on information between each other (More about this later)
*   Better system for uploading an add-on and telling the user about issues
